## Hi There! 👋 <a name="about"></a>

I'm Sam, currently based in Wellington New Zealand. I'm a Developer, Photographer, and Snowboard coach. After hanging up my snowboard boots for a career change, I completed a Diploma in Web Development and Design to kickstart my learning, and then participated in the Mission Ready Cloud and DevOps Developer program to achive a Certificate in Applied Digital Technology Product Solutions.
